      He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he
      had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty
      days a boy had been with him. But after forty days without a fish the
      boy's parents had told him that the old man was now definitely and
      finally <em>salao</em>, which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy
      had gone at their orders in another boat which caught three good fish
      the first week. It made the boy sad to see the old man come in each day
      with his skiff empty and he always went down to help him carry either
      the coiled lines or the gaff and harpoon and the sail that was furled
      around the mast. The sail was patched with flour sacks and, furled, it
      looked like the flag of permanent defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man was thin and gaunt with deep wrinkles in the back of his
      neck. The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings
      from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches
      ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased
      scars from handling heavy fish on the cords. But none of these scars
      were fresh. They were as old as erosions in a fishless desert.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as
      the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;Santiago,&quot; the boy said to him as they climbed the bank from
      where the skiff was hauled up. &quot;I could go with you again. We've made
      some money.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>The old man had taught the boy to fish and the boy loved him.</p>
    <p>
      &quot;No,&quot; the old man said. &quot;You're with a lucky boat. Stay with
      them.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;But remember how you went eighty-seven days without fish and then we
      caught big ones every day for three weeks.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &quot;I remember,&quot; the old man said. &quot;I know you did not leave me
      because you doubted.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>&quot;It was papa made me leave. I am a boy and I must obey him.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I know,&quot; the old man said. &quot;It is quite normal.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;He hasn't much faith.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;No,&quot; the old man said. &quot;But we have. Haven't we?&quot;</p>
    <p>
      &quot;Yes,&quot; the boy said. &quot;Can I offer you a beer on the Terrace
      and then we'll take the stuff home.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>&quot;Why not?&quot; the old man said. &quot;Between fishermen.&quot;</p>
    <p>
      They sat on the Terrace and many of the fishermen made fun of the old man
      and he was not angry. Others, of the older fishermen, looked at him and were
      sad. But they did not show it and they spoke politely about the current and
      the depths they had drifted their lines at and the steady good weather and
      of what they had seen. The successful fishermen of that day were already in
      and had butchered their marlin out and carried them laid full length across
      two planks, with two men staggering at the end of each plank, to the fish
      house where they waited for the ice truck to carry them to the market in
      Havana. Those who had caught sharks had taken them to the shark factory on
      the other side of the cove where they were hoisted on a block and tackle,
      their livers removed, their fins cut off and their hides skinned out and
      their flesh cut into strips for salting.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the wind was in the east a smell came across the harbour from the shark
      factory; but today there was only the faint edge of the odour because the
      wind had backed into the north and then dropped off and it was pleasant and
      sunny on the Terrace.
